## Welcome

I'm just someone who's fascinated with how things work and loves puzzles. One day I decided to check out a programming course out of boredom, and it was love at first line. 

My goal is to become the best software engineer version of myself. To achieve this, I'm constantly learning new things while I'm building projects and contribute to open source.

I use Arch Linux and Neovim, btw.
